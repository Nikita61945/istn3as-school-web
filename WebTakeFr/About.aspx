            The Elite Learning Centre was founded by Sajida Osman in 2014 with just 12 learners. At that time the Centre catered exclusively for the educational needs of learners who were in the process of memorising the Holy Quraan. These children experienced difficulties coping with both academic and religious studies and therefore benefitted from the tuition programme that we offer.
            Over the years we have grown and now cater for both boys and girls. Whilst Hifz students still make up the larger portion of the learners, we now cater for a diverse array of needs of both parents and learners who find our approach more suited to their needs.
